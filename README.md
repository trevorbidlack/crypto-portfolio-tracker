**Crypto Portfolio Tracker**

<u>Purpose</u>
This repository is the central store for this portfolio project that helps people (including myself) track cryptocurrency portfolios effectively and see useful data at a glance to make informed decisions.

While this is a portfolio project meant to be public facing, I intend to use this in my day to day as it will have features that addresses problems I have with other crypto portfolio software.

<u>Goals</u>

- Display historical trends in different prices of currencies, portfolio value, etc
- Store records of trading actions such as buys and sells to understand profit and loss over time
- Track the general market and provide information as to best and worst performing cryptos

<u>Technologies</u>

- Frontend: Typescript, Next.js/React, TailwindCSS, Zustand (state management)
- Backend: Typescript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

TL;DR: MERN Stack
